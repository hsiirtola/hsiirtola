## MePipe
#### [MePipe](https://github.com/hsiirtola/MePipe) is a video player project made using JavaScript and FireBase. In this project I made a frontpage to display the videos from the storage using a database of references. The videos are uploaded using the element on the page and will then be watchable by selecting them from the menu. The code passes the video reference using localstorage and finds the right entry in the database to show the video on the next page.
